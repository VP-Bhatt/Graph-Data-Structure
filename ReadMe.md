# Graph Data Structure
This repository includes the codes for graph coding problems and functions, which I am learning from TAKE U FORWARD youtube channel.

There are different types of graph 
1. Un-directed graph 
    * Graph Not having directed edges, its of two types cyclic and acyclic.
  
2. Directed graph
    * Graph with directed edges, its also of two types cyclic and acyclic.


This repository includes following codes / examples:
### Representation of graph in adjacency matrices using vector.
