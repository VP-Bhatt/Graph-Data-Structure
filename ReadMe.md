# Graph Data Structure
This repository includes the codes for graph coding problems and functions, which I am learning from TAKE U FORWARD youtube channel.

There are different types of graph 
1. Un-directed graph 
    * Graph Not having directed edges, its of two types cyclic and acyclic.
  
2. Directed graph
    * Graph with directed edges, its also of two types cyclic and acyclic.


### This repository includes following codes / examples ( all in c++):
1. Representation of graph using adjacency List.
2. Breadth First Search : it is an algorithm to traverse in graph depending on the order of occurances of nodes in the graph. For example, 1--2--3  the answer will be 1 2 4 3 5
                    |     |
                    4     5
3. Depth First Search : it is an algorithm to traverse in graph depending on the occurence of nodes in depth of the graph. For example,  1--2--3 the answer will be 1 4 2 3 5 or 1 2 3 5 4 both possible 
                     |     |
                     4     5
