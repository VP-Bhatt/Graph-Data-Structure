# Graph Data Structure
This repository includes the codes for graph coding problems and functions, which I am learning from TAKE U FORWARD youtube channel.

There are different types of graph 
1. Un-directed graph 
    * Graph Not having directed edges, its of two types cyclic and acyclic.
  
2. Directed graph
    * Graph with directed edges, its also of two types cyclic and acyclic.


### This repository includes following codes / examples ( all in c++):
1. Representation of graph using adjacency List.
2. Breadth First Search : it is an algorithm to traverse in graph depending on the order of occurances of nodes in the graph. 
3. Depth First Search : it is an algorithm to traverse in graph depending on the occurence of nodes in depth of the graph.
4. cycle detection in un-directed graph using bfs
5. cycle detection in un-directed graph using dfs
6. Detecting is the undirected graph bipartite or not using bfs. 
###### A graph is said to be bipartite if each node in the graph can be assigned 0 or 1 in such a way that any two adjacent node does not have same value. 
######   If an undirected graph have a cycle of odd number of nodes is always Bipartite.

7. Detecting is the undirected graph bipartite or not using dfs.
8. Cycle detection in a directed graph using bfs.
9. cycle detection in a directed graph using dfs.
10. Topolgical Sorting in a directed graph using dfs.
